  initialDialog:
  - 'Hey there!

    I did not expect to meet anyone out here. How did you get here? '
  - Oh, where are my manners. My name is Eleryn. I am the druid of these woods. What
    is your name?
  - Nice to meet you Midas! So you don't remember anything and how you got here.
    Listen. I will help you out of these woods, but first help me get the things
    I came for. Apples. I love them! The tasty ones grow around here.
  acceptOption: Sure.
  acceptAnswer: Let us get to it then!
  declineOption: Sorry, my head still hurts.
  declineAnswer: It's okay, rest for a while then come back to me if you are ready.
    Do not wander away though, these woods can be dangerous!
  comebackAfterDecline: Do you feel any better?
  comebackInProgress: I haven't found any. Have you?
  comebackCompleted: 'Ahh the tastiest apples of Drakewood! Great job!

    As I
    promised I will help you out. Just follow the path and take the first left. At
    the end of the road you can find a wizard. He can help you more than I can. Be
    safe!'
  finalWords: Oh, another advise! See that mountain? Do not go even near it! They
    say a great dragon rests there and roasts anyone who dares to approach his lair.
