  - "Hmm\u2026 I don\u2019t recognize you. Not many outsiders find their way here.
    I am Chief Garrun, and I protect these lands. Tell me, traveler, what brings
    you so far into our realm?"
  - "You say you remember nothing? Hmm\u2026 And yet you claim to have crossed paths
    with a druid named Eleryn.\nEleryn, you say? I know of no one by that name, and
    druids are rare in these lands. Strange\u2026 perhaps your meeting was no mere
    chance."
  - "Intriguing. But mysteries can wait. There are more pressing matters.\nThe lake\u2014foul
    creatures have begun to emerge, threatening our people and our land.\nYou may
    not remember your past, but your presence here could be a sign. Will you lend
    your strength to help us drive these beasts from our waters?"
